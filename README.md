# binaryTree
For this lab we are learning about B-Trees and with the given code provided to us fully understand how they work. 
We are to implement certain different methods to manipulate the B-Tree to get what I what from it in specific depths
or if I want the a “branch” or a “leaf” (I named them “parents” and “children” respectfully) and to draw the tree correctly. 
We are also to draw the B-Tree in its correct order and understand it’s been drawn. With the methods that we are to make 
I must accept a variable and give the correct result. You might notice the pattern in all these methods, which is I check 
if it’s a child manipulate accordingly otherwise loop through the parent nodes to make sure to go through all the children if needed.
The concept for me was easy to understand stand and a tad difficult to implement into code.
